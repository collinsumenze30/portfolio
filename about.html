				<h1 class="title">about me</h1>
			<p class="images-texts">My name is Tobenna. I am a self-taught ux/ux designer and front-end developer(beginner). From an early age, I have been a problem solver. I was that little kid who was always curious about how things work.While in college, I developed an interest in computer technologies. I decided to pursue this passion by taking computer networking classes. I went further to learn programming and take online computer classes. I would design/ code  web and apps  for organizations and schools nearby. </p>

			<h1>why hire me?</h1>
			<p>Having worked as a UI/UX designer for 6 months at blancsoft, I have the experience and skill you are looking for. I have  designed websites and apps using <strong>FIGMA, HTML and CSS</strong>. From my experience as a designer, I have the skill to maintain and add features to different new apps. I always exceed expectations at any job role â€” my former employers speak highly of me. I have an insatiable level of curiosity at any topic that I am less than an expert. And I do lots of research to learn and debunk existing ideas.
